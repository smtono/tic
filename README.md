# TIC - Toxic Internet Communities

An Analysis on Toxic Internet Communities

## Purpose

This project will be an analysis on what makes the internet *TIC* (be upset).
We will find correlations of bridging topics, phrases, and overall similar mannerisms between a few known toxic online communities to see if we can find any similarities between them.

## Problem Statement

Different online communities can be deemed “toxic” meaning they exhibit traits that would deem the community as a whole unwelcoming, intolerant, or unpleasant/unsavory to be around without any prior exposure to their contents.
We will find why these communities seem to be this way and see if there are any bridging ideas that unify these communities, and can possibly be used as a measure for other communities.

### Datasets used

TBD, but most likely scraping data from websites like Twitter, Reddit, Tumblr, etc. As well as analyzing chat logs from popular video games known to be “toxic” such as League of Legends, Call of Duty, etc.

#### Possible Datasets

- *[League of Legends Tribunal](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/simshengxue/league-of-legends-tribunal-chatlogs)*
- *[Toxic Conversation Structure GitHub Repo](https://github.com/msaveski/toxic_conversation_structure)*

## Challenges Addressed

- Is there any way to quantify how “toxic” communities are?
- Is there a set of metrics we can create to determine how “toxic” a community is?
- Can we find similarities between communities in their mannerisms to determine if they are equally “toxic” or not?

## Significance

Online spaces have a tendency to radicalize themselves over time if no one intervenes. Is there a way to expose these mannerisms early to stop toxicity from happening to begin with?
In the current day and age where online discourse can lead to real life violence, it does have immense significance.

## Methodology

- Python
- MySQL
- Entity recognition mining
- Text mining
- Sentiment analysis

## Expected Results

We expect to have a set of metrics that can be used to deem how unfavorable and toxic a community is in its current state.
